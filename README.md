### Overview:
This assignment required us to design an Online Matching System(OMS) for students that require tutoring services. How it works is that students will be able to create 2 types of bids (open bid, close bid) for the subject that would want tutoring for. Tutors would then be able to login into the OMS and offer their bids or accept the stated bid by the students if the tutor finds the student's bid details to the tutor's liking. Student will then be able to choose the tutors based on the best offers from the tutors that have bidded. There is also a messaging system for close bidding to allow students and tutor to discuss an agreement for the tutoring service. Once a bid is finalized/chosen, a contract will generate for both parties to sign to agree upon the tutoring service's details from number of lessons, duration, any free lessons, price per session/hour, lesson time, day of the week and etc.
